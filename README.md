# Mitsors Web

## Run

Development server runs on http://localhost:5000

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production start on port 5000 after build:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

## API Integration

- Recommended (dev, backend on localhost:3000): set `API_BASE_URL` only. Requests to `/api/v1/*` are proxied, preserving same-origin cookies.
- Alternative: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` for direct cross-origin calls. Use this only if you specifically want to bypass the proxy.
 - Toggle: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PROXY=true` to force proxy mode even if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is set (client will use relative `/api/v1/*`).

Example `.env.local` (recommended dev):

```
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PROXY=true
```

Example `.env.local` (direct calls):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.mitsors.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PROXY=false
```

- Backend: Implemented in the separate `mitsor-api` repository; frontend uses `/api/v1/prices/submit`.
- Code mapping (frontend):
  - API client: lib/api/client.ts (proxy/direct toggle, auth, JSON)
  - Proxy rewrites: next.config.ts (`API_BASE_URL`)

## Reproduction Steps
1. Start backend at `http://localhost:3000` and frontend at `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Ensure `.env.local` has `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PROXY=true`.
3. Open Dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`:
   - View regional price cards for your region (defaults to Region III • Angeles)
   - Browse the Regional Price Overview table showing all regions
   - Toggle between light and dark mode using the theme button
4. Click **Submit Price** button in the header.
5. Fill the form:
   - Select Region from dropdown (searchable)
   - Select City/Municipality (updates based on region)
   - Select Livestock Type (Boar, Breeder, Fattener, Gilt, Piglet, or Sow)
   - Optionally select Breed (e.g., American Landrace, Berkshire, Crossbred)
   - Enter Price (50–500 PHP)
   - Select or keep default Date Observed
   - Optionally add Notes
6. Click **Submit** and observe success toast.
7. Confirm the new entry in the database (`price_inputs`).
8. Verify the dashboard updates with the new price data.

## Notes
- Color theme uses semantic tokens configured in `app/globals.css` for both light and dark modes.
- Dark mode is fully supported across all components with smooth transitions.
- All server interactions are via TanStack Query; UI-only state uses React hooks.
- Regional price table shows real-time data from all Philippine regions.
- Form dropdowns are searchable for better UX with large datasets.
- Livestock types and breeds are managed in `constants/livestock-data.ts`.
- Philippine regions and cities are managed in `constants/philippine-locations.ts`.
